This project is a collection of single page tutorials that I have been doing based on materials (videos, PDFs, etc...) that I have
watched on the internet. The main goal of this collection of small projects is to learn the FE technologies: HTML, CSS, SaSS, JS, etc...

Of course I always try to add something personal, but in its majority the content remains as in the original.
