This example is for monkeys and mountains


The Mormeset:

The idea is to have a mormeset that goes from tree to tree collecting fruit, with 
3-4 different types of fruits. For each different collected type of fruit the
player get points.

The monkey jump from one tree to another against the clock avoiding predators.

The main predators are:
	-Bird: Can take the monkey when he jumps from one tree to anther.
	-Snake: The snake is hanging out in the tree and can catch the monkey in the tree.
				So the monkey has to be really fast to avoid the snake in the tree.

The reward when the monkey gets to the end, the entire family of marmosets are there
waiting.

The Limour:

The idea is that the Limour goes running in the floor taking fruit and avoid the
"fossa" (Kind of small Leopard), but the biggest predator are humans that goes with
nets and capture them.

If the furtive captures the limour then this will appear crying in the net (GAME OVER).
